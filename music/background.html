		<h2> Did you know I DJ? </h2>
		<p>I started mixing as a comical side hobby during my senior year of high school with one of my best friends. It didn’t become serious until the summer after my freshman year and have been obsessed every since! I was enrolled in piano, karnatic singing, and kuchipudi growing up so I’d like to say I have a pretty good ear for key and rhythm. It started for fun with my own dance team but as other schools and dance competitions started asking, it became more of a dedicated hobby. I’ve dabbled in Garageband, FL studio, Sony, and Ableton, but ended up upgrading and settling with Logic Pro. I’m proud of how far I’ve come, but my aim will always be to produce some of my own music. If you’re an aspiring DJ, don’t be afraid to reach out to me! I’d love to help :)</p>
